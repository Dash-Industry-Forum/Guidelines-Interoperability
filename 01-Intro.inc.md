# Purpose # {#why-does-this-document-exist}

The guidelines defined in this document support the creation of interoperable services for high-quality video distribution based on MPEG-DASH and related standards. These guidelines are provided in order to address DASH-IF members' needs and industry best practices. The guidelines support the implementation of conforming service offerings as well as DASH client implementations.

The restricted timing model constrains the ordinary timing model defined in [[!DASH]] primarily by disallowing gaps in presentations, thereby increasing the compatibility of DASH services with devices that do not have robust support for playback of content with gaps.

This timing model also provides editorial flexibility for the presentation author by allowing new periods to be started at any point. This is achieved by:

1. Strictly defining the period boundary rules on the DASH service side.
1. Permitting fleixble behavior from clients in how they transition between periods (to account for implementation limitations).

Note: Some alternative timing model interpretations significantly restrict the ability of content authors to define period boundaries.

In addition to defining the constraints for a restricted timing model, this document attempts to explain and illustrate many DASH timing concepts that often cause confusion, without constraining them further than already done by DASH-IF general guidelines, [[!DASH]] or [[!CMAF]].

While alternative interpretations may be equally valid in terms of standards conformance, services and clients created following the guidelines defined in this document can be expected to exhibit highly interoperable behavior between different implementations.

This part of the DASH-IF implementation guidelines is published as a stand-alone document for editorial reasons. Refer to the master document to understand the context in which this document should be viewed.

# Interpretation # {#interpretation}

Requirements in this document describe service and client behaviors that DASH-IF considers interoperable.

If a **service provider** follows these requirements in a published DASH service, the published DASH service is likely to experience successful playback on a wide variety of clients and exhibit graceful degradation when a client does not support all features used by the service.

If a **client implementer** follows the client-oriented requirements described in this document, the DASH client will play content conforming to this document provided that the client device media platform supports all features used by a particular DASH service (e.g. the codecs and DRM systems).

This document uses statements of fact when describing normative requirements defined in referenced specifications such as [[!DASH]] and [[!CMAF]]. References are typically provided to indicate where the requirements are defined.

[[!RFC2119]] statements (e.g. "SHALL", "SHOULD" and "MAY") are used when this document defines a new requirement or further constrains a requirement from a referenced document.

<div class="example">
Statement of fact:

* A DASH presentation **is** a sequence of consecutive non-overlapping periods [[!DASH]].

New or more constrained requirement:

* Segments **SHALL NOT** use the MPEG-TS container format.

</div>

There is no strict backward compatibility with previous versions - best practices change over time and what was once considered sensible may be replaced by a superior approach later on. Therefore, clients and services that were conforming to version N of this document are not guaranteed to conform to version N+1.

# DASH and related standards # {#dash-is-important}

DASH (dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP) [[!DASH]] is a technology for adaptive media delivery. Initially published by ISO/IEC in April 2012, it has been continually updated, with the 4th edition published in 2020.

CMAF (common media application format) [[!CMAF]] is a media container format based on ISO Base Media File Format [[!ISOBMFF]]. It defines data structures for media delivery compatible with DASH and other similar technologies such as [[HLS]]. Initially published by ISO/IEC in 2018, it has been updated in 2019 with the publishing of the 2nd edition.

This document is based on the 4th edition DASH [[!DASH]] and 2nd edition CMAF [[!CMAF]] specifications.

DASH together with related standards and specifications is the foundation for an ecosystem of services and clients that work together to enable audio/video/text and related content to be presented to end-users.

[[!DASH]] defines a highly flexible set of building blocks that needs to be constrained to ensure interoperable behavior in common scenarios. The necessary media container constraints are largely defined by [[!CMAF]] and [[!DASH-CMAF]]. This document defines further constraints to limit DASH features to those that are considered appropriate for use in interoperable clients and services.

Clients consuming DASH content will need to interact with the host device's media platform. The guidelines in this document assume that the media platform implements APIs that are equivalent to Media Source Extensions [[media-source]] and Encrypted Media Extensions [[encrypted-media]]. API level compatibility is not required but equivalent features are expected.

This document was generated in close coordination with [[DVB-DASH]]. The features are aligned to the extent considered reasonable. The tools and features are aligned to the extent considered reasonable. In addition, DASH-IF worked closely with ATSC to develop a DASH profile for ATSC3.0 for broadcast distribution [[ATSC3]].

## Structure of a DASH presentation ## {#what-is-dash}

[[!DASH]] specifies the structure of a DASH <dfn>presentation</dfn>, which consists primarily of:

1. The manifest or <dfn>MPD</dfn>, which describes the content and how it can be accessed.
1. Data containers that clients will download during playback of a [=presentation=] in order to obtain media samples.

<figure>
	<img src="Diagrams/DashStructure.png" >
	<figcaption>Relationships of primary DASH data structures and the standards they are defined in.</figcaption>
</figure>

The [=MPD=] is an XML file that follows a schema defined in [[!DASH]]. Various 3rd party extension points are defined in the XML schema. This document defines some extensions, as do other industry specifications.

[[!DASH]] defines two data container formats, one based on [[!ISOBMFF]] and the other [[!MPEG2TS]]. However, only the former is used in modern solutions. This document only supports services using the [[!ISOBMFF]] container format.

[[!CMAF]] is a constrained media format based on [[!ISOBMFF]], specifically designed for adaptive streaming. This document requires the use of [[!CMAF]] compatible data containers. The requirements for the usage of CMAF with DASH are defined by [[!DASH-CMAF]].

Note: The relationship to [[!CMAF]] is constrained to the container format, as primarily expressed by [[!DASH-CMAF]]. In particular, there is no requirement to conform to [[!CMAF]] media profiles.

The data container format defines the physical structure of the following components of a [=presentation=]:

1. Each [=representation=] contains an initialization segment.
1. Each [=representation=] contains any number of [=media segments=].
1. Some [=representations=] may contain an index segment, depending on the [=addressing mode=] used.

Note: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) [[HLS]] is an adaptive media delivery technology similar to DASH that also supports CMAF. Under certain constraints, content conforming to CMAF can be delivered to clients using both DASH and HLS.

## Terminology cross-reference across standards ## {#terms-cross-reference}

Different documents often use different terms to refer to the same structural components of DASH [=presentations=]. A quick cross-reference of terms commonly found causing confusion is presented here:

## Terminology choices in this document ## {#confusing-terms}

This document is intended to be a set of guidelines easily understood by solution designers and developers. In the interest of ease of understanding, some important adjustments in terminology are made compared to the underlying standards, described here.

[[!DASH]] has the concept of "segment" (URL-addressable media object) and "subsegment" (byte range of URL-addressable media object), whereas [[!CMAF]] does not make such a distinction. This document uses [[!CMAF]] terminology, with the term "segment" in this document being equivalent to "CMAF segment". The term "segment" in this document may be equivalent to either "segment" or "subsegment" in [[!DASH]], depending on the [=addressing mode=] used.

This document's concept of the [=MPD timeline=] is not directly expressed in [[!DASH]]. To improve understandability of the timing model, this document splits the DASH concept of "presentation timeline" ([[!DASH]] 7.2.1) into two separate concepts: the aggregated component ([=MPD timeline=]) and the [=representation=] specific component ([=sample timeline=]). These concepts are distinct but mutually connected via metadata in the [=MPD=].

[[!DASH]] uses "representation" to refer to a set of files and associated metadata, with the same "representation" possibly used in different parts of a DASH [=presentation=] and/or in different [=presentations=]. This document uses [=representation=] to refer to an individual instance of a [[!DASH]] "representation" - a set of data in an [=MPD=] that references some files containing media samples. Using the same files in two places effecticely means using two [=representations=], whereas in [[!DASH]] terminology it would be valid to call that a single [=representation=] used with individual conditions/caveats that apply to each usage. The deviation in terminology is intentional as it simplifies understanding and avoids having to juggle the two concepts (as the "shared" view is typically not relevant).
