# Segment addressing modes # {#addressing}

This section defines the <dfn>addressing modes</dfn> that can be used for referencing [=media segments=], initialization segments and index segments in interopreable DASH presentations.

[=Addressing modes=] not defined in this chapter SHALL NOT be used by DASH services. Clients SHOULD support all [=addressing modes=] defined in this chapter.

All [=representations=] in the same adaptation set SHALL use the same [=addressing mode=]. [=Representations=] in different adaptation sets MAY use different [=addressing modes=]. [[#timing-connectivity|Period-connected representations]] SHALL use the same [=addressing mode=] in every [=period=].

You SHOULD choose the addressing mode based on the nature of the content:

<dl class="switch">

: Content generated on the fly
:: Use [=explicit addressing=].

: Content generated in advance of publishing
:: Use [=indexed addressing=] or [=explicit addressing=].

</dl>

A service MAY use [=simple addressing=] which enables the packager logic to be very simple. This simplicity comes at a cost of reduced applicability to multi-period scenarios and reduced client compatibility.

[=Indexed addressing=] enables all data associated with a single [=representation=] to be stored in a single CMAF track file from which byte ranges are served to clients to supply [=media segments=], the initialization segment and the index segment. This gives it some unique advantages:

* A single large file is more efficient to transfer and cache than 100 000 or more small files, reducing computational and I/O overhead.
* CDNs are aware of the nature of byte-range requests and can preemptively read-ahead to fill the cache ahead of playback.

## Indexed addressing ## {#addressing-indexed}

A representation that uses <dfn>indexed addressing</dfn> consists of a CMAF track file containing an index segment, an initialization segment and a sequence of [=media segments=].

Note: This addressing mode is sometimes called "SegmentBase" in other documents.

Clauses in section only apply to [=representations=] that use [=indexed addressing=].

Note: [[!DASH]] makes a distinction between "segment" (HTTP-addressable entity) and "subsegment" (byte range of an HTTP-addressable entity). This document does not make such a distinction and has no concept of subsegments. Usage of "segment" here matches the definition of CMAF segment [[!CMAF]].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/IndexedAddressing.png" >
	<figcaption>[=Indexed addressing=] is based on an index segment that references all [=media segments=].</figcaption>
</figure>

The [=MPD=] defines the byte range in the CMAF track file that contains the index segment. The index segment informs the client of all the [=media segments=] that exist, the time spans they cover on the [=sample timeline=] and their byte ranges.

Multiple [=representations=] SHALL NOT be stored in the same CMAF track file (i.e. no multiplexed [=representations=] are to be used).

At least one `Representation/BaseURL` element SHALL be present in the [=MPD=], containing a URL pointing to the CMAF track file.

The `SegmentBase@indexRange` attribute SHALL be present in the [=MPD=]. The value of this attribute identifies the byte range of the index segment in the CMAF track file ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.2). The value is a `byte-range-spec` as defined in [[!RFC7233]], referencing a single range of bytes.

The `SegmentBase@timescale` attribute SHALL be present and its value SHALL match the value of the `timescale` field in the index segment (in the [[!ISOBMFF]] `sidx` box) and the value of the `timescale` field in the initialization segment (in the `tkhd` box [[!ISOBMFF]]).

The `SegmentBase/Initialization@range` attribute SHALL identify the byte range of the initialization segment in the CMAF track file. The value is a `byte-range-spec` as defined in [[!RFC7233]], referencing a single range of bytes. The `Initialization@sourceURL` attribute SHALL NOT be used.

<div class="example">
Below is an example of common usage of [=indexed addressing=].

The example defines a [=timescale=] of 48000 units per second, with the [=period=] starting at position 8100 (or 0.16875 seconds) on the [=sample timeline=]. The client can use the index segment referenced by `indexRange` to determine where the [=media segment=] containing position 8100 (and all other [=media segments=]) can be found. The byte range of the initialization segment is also provided.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011">
	<Period>
		<AdaptationSet>
			<Representation>
				<BaseURL>showreel_audio_dashinit.mp4</BaseURL>
				<SegmentBase timescale="48000" presentationTimeOffset="8100" indexRange="848-999">
					<Initialization range="0-847"/>
				</SegmentBase>
			</Representation>
		</AdaptationSet>
	</Period>
</MPD>
</xmp>

Parts of the [=MPD=] structure that are not relevant for this chapter have been omitted - this is not a fully functional [=MPD=] file.
</div>

## Structure of the index segment ## {#addressing-indexed-indexstructure}

The index segment SHALL consist of a single Segment Index Box (`sidx`) as defined by [[!ISOBMFF]]. The field layout of this data structure is as follows:

<xmp>
aligned(8) class SegmentIndexBox extends FullBox('sidx', version, 0) {
	unsigned int(32) reference_ID;
	unsigned int(32) timescale;

	if (version==0) {
		unsigned int(32) earliest_presentation_time;
		unsigned int(32) first_offset;
	}
	else {
		unsigned int(64) earliest_presentation_time;
		unsigned int(64) first_offset;
	}

	unsigned int(16) reserved = 0;
	unsigned int(16) reference_count;

	for (i = 1; i <= reference_count; i++)
	{
		bit (1) reference_type;
		unsigned int(31) referenced_size;
		unsigned int(32) subsegment_duration;
		bit(1) starts_with_SAP;
		unsigned int(3) SAP_type;
		unsigned int(28) SAP_delta_time;
	}
}
</xmp>

The values of the fields SHOULD be determined as follows:

Note: The normative definitions of the fields are provided by [[!ISOBMFF]]. This document describes how to determine the correct values, relating the fields to DASH specific concepts.

: `reference_ID`
:: The `track_ID` of the [[!ISOBMFF]] track that contains the data of this [=representation=].

: `timescale`
:: Same as the `timescale` field of the Media Header Box and same as the `SegmentBase@timescale` attribute in the [=MPD=].

: `earliest_presentation_time`
:: The start timestamp of the first [=media segment=] on the [=sample timeline=], in [=timescale units=].

: `first_offset`
:: Distance from the end of the index segment to the first [=media segment=], in bytes. For example, 0 indicates that the first [=media segment=] immediately follows the index segment.

: `reference_count`
:: Total number of [=media segments=] referenced by the index segment.

: `reference_type`
:: `0`

: `referenced_size`
:: Size of the [=media segment=] in bytes. [=Media segments=] are assumed to be consecutive, so this is also the distance to the start of the next [=media segment=].

: `subsegment_duration`
:: Duration of the [=media segment=] in [=timescale units=].

: `starts_with_SAP`
:: `1`

: `SAP_type`
:: Either `1` or `2`, depending on the sample structure in the [=media segment=].

: `SAP_delta_time`
:: `0`

Issue: We need to clarify how to determine the right value for `SAP_type` [GitHub #235](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-IOP/issues/235).

### Moving the period start point (indexed addressing) ### {#addressing-indexed-startpoint}

When splitting [=periods=] in two or performing other types of editorial timing adjustments, a service might want to start a [=period=] at a point after the "natural" start point of the [=representations=] within.

For [=representations=] that use [=indexed addressing=], perform the following adjustments to set a new [=period=] start point:

1. Update `SegmentBase@presentationTimeOffset` to indicate the desired start point on the [=sample timeline=].
1. Update `Period@duration` to match the new duration.

## Explicit addressing ## {#addressing-explicit}

A [=representation=] that uses <dfn>explicit addressing</dfn> consists of a set of [=media segments=] accessed via URLs constructed using a template defined in the [=MPD=], with the exact [=sample timeline=] time span covered by the samples in each [=media segment=] described in the [=MPD=].

Note: This addressing mode is sometimes called "SegmentTemplate with SegmentTimeline" in other documents.

Clauses in section only apply to [=representations=] that use [=explicit addressing=].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/ExplicitAddressing.png" >
	<figcaption>[=Explicit addressing=] uses a segment template that is combined with explicitly defined time spans for each [=media segment=] in order to reference [=media segments=], either by start time or by sequence number.</figcaption>
</figure>

The [=MPD=] SHALL contain a `SegmentTemplate/SegmentTimeline` element, containing a set of [=segment references=] that satisfies the requirements defined in this document. The [=segment references=] exist as a sequence of `S` elements, each of which references one or more [=media segments=] with start time `S@t` and duration `S@d` [=timescale units=] on the [=sample timeline=] ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.6). The `SegmentTemplate@duration` attribute is not present ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.2).

To enable concise [=segment reference=] definitions, an `S` element may represent a repeating [=segment reference=] that indicates a number of repeated consecutive [=media segments=] with the same duration. The value of `S@r` indicates the number of additional consecutive [=media segments=] that exist ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.6).

Note: Only additional [=segment references=] are counted by `@r`, so `S@r=5` indicates a total of 6 consecutive [=media segments=] with the same duration.

The [=segment start point=] is calculated by adding the [=segment start point=] and duration of the previous [=media segment=], unless `S@t` is specified in which case `S@t` is the [=segment start point=] on the [=sample timeline=] ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.6).

The value of `S@r` is nonnegative, except for the last `S` element which MAY have a negative value in `S@r` ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.6), indicating that the repeated [=segment references=] continue indefinitely up to a [=media segment=] that either ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end point.

[[#timing-mpd-updates|Updates to the MPD of a dynamic presentation]] MAY add more `S` elements, remove expired `S` elements, increment `SegmentTemplate@startNumber`, add the `S@t` attribute to the first `S` element or increase the value of `S@r` on the last `S` element but SHALL NOT otherwise modify existing `S` elements.

The `S@n` attribute SHALL NOT be used - segment numbers form a continuous sequence starting with `SegmentTemplate@startNumber`.

The `SegmentTemplate@eptDelta` attribute SHALL NOT be present. The information represented by this attribute can be calculated independently and having it be present would only create additional possibility for conflicting data.

The `SegmentTemplate@media` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing [=media segments=]. The `SegmentTemplate@initialization` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing initialization segments.

Either the `$Time$` or `$Number$` template variable SHALL be present in `SegmentTemplate@media` to uniquely identify [=media segments=]:

* If using `$Number$` addressing, the number of the first segment reference is defined by `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` (default value 1) ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.5.3).
* If using `$Time$` addressing, the value for each [=segment reference=] is the [=segment start point=] on the [=sample timeline=], in [=timescale units=] ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.5.3).

<div class="example">
Below is an example of common usage of [=explicit addressing=].

The example defines 225 [=media segments=] starting at position 900 (or 0.9 seconds) on the [=sample timeline=] and lasting for a total of 900.225 seconds. The [=period=] is only 900 seconds long, so the last 0.225 seconds of content is clipped (out of bounds samples may also simply be omitted from the last [=media segment=]). The [=period=] start point is at position 900 (or 0.9 seconds) on the [=sample timeline=] which matches the start position of the first [=media segment=] found at the relative URL `video/900.m4s`.

Below is an example of [=explicit addressing=] used in a scenario where different [=media segments=] have different durations (e.g. due to encoder limitations).

The example defines a sequence of 11 [=media segments=] starting at position 120 (or 0.12 seconds) on the [=sample timeline=] and lasting for a total of 95520 units at a [=timescale=] of 1000 units per second (which results in 95.52 seconds of data). The [=period=] start point on the [=sample timeline=] is at position 810 (or 0.81 seconds), which is within the first [=media segment=], found at the relative URL `video/120.m4s`. The fifth [=media segment=] repeats once, resulting in a sixth [=media segment=] with the same duration.

### Moving the period start point (explicit addressing) ### {#addressing-explicit-startpoint}

When splitting [=periods=] in two or performing other types of editorial timing adjustments, a service might want to start a [=period=] at a point after the "natural" start point of the [=representations=] within.

For [=representations=] that use [=explicit addressing=], perform the following adjustments to set a new [=period=] start point:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Update `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` to indicate the desired start point on the [=sample timeline=].
1. Update `Period@duration` to match the new duration.
1. Remove any [=unnecessary segment references=].
1. If using the `$Number$` template variable, increment `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` by the number of [=media segments=] removed from the beginning of the [=representation=].

</div>

Note: See [[#representation-timing]] and [[#timing-mpd-updates-remove-content]] to understand the constraints that apply to [=segment reference=] removal.

## Simple addressing ## {#addressing-simple}

A representation that uses <dfn>simple addressing</dfn> consists of a set of [=media segments=] accessed via URLs constructed using a template defined in the [=MPD=], with the [=MPD=] describing the nominal time span of the [=sample timeline=] covered by each [=media segment=].

Advisement: [=Simple addressing=] defines the nominal time span of each [=media segment=] in the [=MPD=]. The true time span covered by samples within the [=media segment=] can be slightly different than the nominal time span. See [[#addressing-simple-inaccuracy]].

Note: This addressing mode is sometimes called "SegmentTemplate without SegmentTimeline" in other documents.

Clauses in section only apply to [=representations=] that use [=simple addressing=].

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/SimpleAddressing.png" >
	<figcaption>[=Simple addressing=] uses a segment template that is combined with approximate first [=media segment=] timing information and an average [=media segment=] duration in order to reference [=media segments=], either by start time or by sequence number. Note that `@eptDelta` does not affect the generated paths!</figcaption>
</figure>

The `SegmentTemplate@duration` attribute defines the nominal duration of a [=media segment=] in [=timescale units=] ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.2).

The set of [=segment references=] consists of the first [=media segment=] starting `SegmentTemplate@eptDelta` [=timescale units=] relative to the [=period=] start point and all other [=media segments=] following in a consecutive series of equal time spans of `SegmentTemplate@duration` [=timescale units=], ending with a [=media segment=] that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end time. The `@eptDelta` attribute SHALL be present if its value is not zero.

Note: `@eptDelta` is expressed as an offset from the [=period=] start point to the [=segment start point=] of the first [=media segment=] ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.2). In other words, the value will be negative if the first [=media segment=] starts before the [=period=] start point.

Advisement: `@eptDelta` is new in [[!DASH]] 4th edition (published 2020) and DASH client support is not yet widespread. Clients that do not implement support for `@eptDelta` may fail to correctly begin or end playback of [=periods=] that use [=simple addressing=] with `@eptDelta != 0`. If the client cannot be upgraded to consider `@eptDelta` then you are advised to use [=explicit addressing=] with such content.

The `SegmentTemplate@media` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing [=media segments=]. The `SegmentTemplate@initialization` attribute SHALL contain the URL template for referencing initialization segments.

Either the `$Time$` or `$Number$` template variable SHALL be present in `SegmentTemplate@media` to uniquely identify [=media segments=]:

* If using `$Number$` addressing, the number of the first segment reference is defined by `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` (default value 1) ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.5.3).
* If using `$Time$` addressing, the template value for each [=segment reference=] is the [=segment start point=] on the [=sample timeline=] minus `@eptDelta` ([[!DASH]] 5.3.9.5.3).

<div class="example">
Below is an example of common usage of [=simple addressing=].

The example defines a [=sample timeline=] with a [=timescale=] of 1000 units per second, with the [=period=] starting at position 900 (or 0.9 seconds) on the [=sample timeline=] and the first [=media segment=] starting at position 400 (or 0.4 seconds). The average duration of a [=media segment=] is 4001 (4.001 seconds). [=Media segment=] numbering starts at 800, so the first [=media segment=] is found at the relative URL `video/800.m4s`. The sequence of [=media segments=] continues to the end of the period, which is 900 seconds long, making for a total of 226 defined [=segment references=].

The [=period=] start point is 500 milliseconds after the [=segment start point=] of the first [=media segment=] and the [=period=] end point is approximately 275 milliseconds after the [=segment start point=] of the last [=media segment=]. The real timing of the samples within the [=media segments=] may differ from these nominal values in the [=MPD=], to the extent permitted by the timing model.

### Inaccuracy in media segment timing when using simple addressing ### {#addressing-simple-inaccuracy}

When using [=simple addressing=], the samples contained in a [=media segment=] MAY cover a different time span on the [=sample timeline=] than what is indicated by the nominal timing in the [=MPD=], as long as no constraints defined in this document are violated by this deviation.

<figure>
	<img src="Images/Timing/InaccurateAddressing.png" >
	<figcaption>[=Simple addressing=] relaxes the requirement on [=media segment=] contents matching the [=sample timeline=]. Red boxes indicate samples.</figcaption>
</figure>

The allowed deviation is defined as the maximum offset between the edges of the nominal time span (as defined by the [=MPD=]) and the edges of the true time span (as defined by the contents of the [=media segment=]). The deviation is evaluated separately for each edge.

Advisement: This allowed deviation does not relax any requirements that do not explicitly define an exception.

The maximum deviation of either edge is 50% of the nominal [=media segment=] duration and MAY be in either direction ([[!DASH]] 7.2.1).

Note: This results in a maximum true duration of 200% (+50% outward extension on both edges) and a minimum true duration of 1 sample (-50% inward from both edges would result in 0 duration but empty [=media segments=] are not allowed).

Allowing inaccurate timing is intended to enable reasoning on the [=sample timeline=] using average values for [=media segment=] timing. If the addressing data says that a [=media segment=] contains 4 seconds of data on average, a client can predict with reasonable accuracy which samples are found in which [=media segments=], while at the same time the service is not required to publish per-segment timing data in the MPD. It is expected that the content is packaged with this contraint in mind (i.e. **every** segment cannot be inaccurate in the same direction - a shorter segment now implies a longer segment in the future to make up for it).

To ensure that no gaps in the timeline are introduced by the allowed inaccuracy, additional constraints apply to the contents of [=media segments=] at the edges of a [=period=]:

* The [=media segment] that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point SHALL contain a sample that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point.
* The [=media segment] that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end point SHALL contain a sample that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end point.

<div class="example">
Consider a [=media segment=] with a nominal start time of 8 seconds from [=period=] start and a nominal duration of 4 seconds, within a [=period=] of unlimited duration.

The following are all valid contents for such a [=media segment=]:

* samples from 8 to 12 seconds (perfect accuracy)
* samples from 6 to 14 seconds (maximally large segment allowed, 50% increase from both ends)
* samples from 9.9 to 10 seconds (near-minimally small segment; while we allow a 50% decrease from both ends, potentially resulting in zero duration, every segment must still contain at least one sample)
* samples from 6 to 10 seconds (maximal offset toward zero point at both ends)
* samples from 10 to 14 seconds (maximal offset away from zero point at both ends)

Near [=period=] boundaries, all the constraints of timing and addressing must still be respected! Consider a [=media segment=] with a nominal start time of 0 seconds from [=period=] start and a nominal duration of 4 seconds. If such a [=media segment=] contained samples from 1 to 5 seconds (offset of 1 second away from zero point at both ends, which is within acceptable limits) it would be nonconforming because of the requirement that the first [=media segment=] contain a media sample that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point.
</div>

### Moving the period start point (simple addressing) ### {#addressing-simple-startpoint}

When splitting [=periods=] in two or performing other types of editorial timing adjustments, a service might want to start a [=period=] at a point after the "natural" start point of the [=representations=] within. This can be challenging when using [=simple addressing=].

Advisement: The [=media segment=] that overlaps the [=period=] start point must contain a sample that starts at or overlaps the [=period=] start point. Likewise, the [=media segment=] that overlaps the [=period=] end point must contain a sample that ends at or overlaps the [=period=] end point. These constraints are defined in [[#addressing-simple-inaccuracy]] and typically make it impossible to move the [=period=] start point or split a [=period=] when using [=simple addressing=] and taking advantage of the inaccuracy allowed to exist between nominal timing of the [=sample timeline=] and the true contents of the [=media segments=].

The rest of this chapter assumes that the nominal timing of [=media segments=] matches the real timing. If you cannot satisfy this constraint but still wish to move the [=period=] start point, convert to [=explicit addressing=]. See [[#addressing-simple-to-explicit]].

To move the [=period=] start point for [=representations=] that use [=simple addressing=] without timing inaccuracy:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Update `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` to indicate the desired [=period=] start point on the [=sample timeline=].
1. Update `SegmentTemplate@eptDelta` to indicate the relative position of the [=segment start point=] of the first [=media segment=] from the start of the [=period=] (with a negative sign indicating the [=segment start point=] is before the [=period=] start point).
1. If using the `$Time$` template variable and if the value of `@eptDelta` changed in the previous step, rename all [=media segments=] to conform to the new pattern generated by the URL template. The pattern will change whenever `@eptDelta` changes because `$Time$` refers not only to the [=segment start point=] but also includes `@eptDelta`.
1. If using the `$Number$` template variable, increment `SegmentTemplate@startNumber` by the number of [=media segments=] removed from the beginning of the [=representation=].
1. Update `Period@duration` to match the new duration.

</div>

Advisement: `@eptDelta` is new in [[!DASH]] 4th edition (published 2020). If the resulting `SegmentTemplate@eptDelta` value is not zero, DASH clients that do not support `@eptDelta` may exhibit incorrect behavior when transitioning between [=periods=]. The only workaround is to either [[#addressing-simple-to-explicit|convert to explicit addressing]] or to choose a [=period=] start point that overlaps with the [=segment start points=] of all [=representations=] in all adaptation sets that use [=simple addressing=]! Such points might not exist, depending on the [=media segment=] structure of the [=presentation=].

### Converting simple addressing to explicit addressing ### {#addressing-simple-to-explicit}

It may sometimes be desirable to convert a presentation from [=simple addressing=] to [=explicit addressing=]. This chapter provides an algorithm to do this.

Advisement: [=Simple addressing=] allows for inaccuracy in [=media segment=] timing. No inaccuracy is allowed by [=explicit addressing=]. The mechanism of conversion described here is only valid when there is no inaccuracy. If the nominal time spans in original the [=MPD=] differ from the true time spans of the [=media segments=], re-package the content from scratch using [=explicit addressing=] instead of converting the [=MPD=].

To perform the conversion, execute the following steps:

<div class="algorithm">

1. Calculate the number of [=media segments=] in the [=representation=] as `SegmentCount = Ceil((AsSeconds(Period@duration) - AsSeconds(SegmentTempalte@eptDelta)) / ( SegmentTemplate@duration / SegmentTemplate@timescale))`.
1. Update the MPD.
	1. Add a single `SegmentTemplate/SegmentTimeline` element.
	1. Add a single `SegmentTimeline/S` element.
	1. Set `S@t` to equal `SegmentTemplate@presentationTimeOffset` plus `@eptDelta`.
	1. Set `S@d` to equal `SegmentTemplate@duration`.
	1. Remove `SegmentTemplate@duration`.
	1. Set `S@r` to `SegmentCount - 1`.
	1. Remove `SegmentTemplate@eptDelta`. It is not needed nor permitted with [=explicit addressing=].
1. If using `$Time$` addressing in `SegmentTemplate@media`, rename all [=media segments=] to match the [=segment start point=] in the template variable ([=simple addressing=] uses [=segment start point=] minus `@eptDelta` for `$Time$`).

</div>

<div class="example">
Below is an example of a [=simple addressing=] [=representation=] before conversion.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011">
	<Period duration="PT900S">
		<AdaptationSet>
			<Representation>
				<SegmentTemplate timescale="1000" presentationTimeOffset="900" eptDelta="-500"
						media="video/$Number$.m4s" initialization="video/init.mp4"
						duration="4001" startNumber="800" />
			</Representation>
		</AdaptationSet>
	</Period>
</MPD>
</xmp>

As part of the conversion, we calculate `SegmentCount = Ceil((900 - (-0.5)) / (4001 / 1000)) = 226`.

After conversion, we arrive at the following result.

<xmp highlight="xml">
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011">
